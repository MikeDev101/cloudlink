## Supported Versions

If you are operating your CloudLink server in a public-access environment, it is up to the server administrator to keep the server up-to-date.

All versions of CloudLink Legacy are to be considered deprecated and obsolete. If you are using CloudLink Legacy, you should consider upgrading.

If CloudLink has been updated, you are to assume that it will no longer be supported.
