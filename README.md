# The CloudLink Suite

CloudLink, CloudAccount, CloudCoin, and CloudDisk are a series of APIs developed for Scratch 3.0 designed to make cross-project cloud variables fast, custom, and more reliable, as well as provide 100% free-to-use cloud services for psuedo digital currency as well as a free cloud drive.

### CloudLink
CloudLink is a high-speed, reliable, and custom websocket extension. It permits cross-project (as well as cross-program) cloud variables. It also enables full-duplex networking and limitless possibilities for Scratch 3.0 projects.

### CloudAccount
CloudAccount is an umbrella-service for the CloudLink suite, as it provides authentication and basic protection of your CloudCoins and your CloudDisk drive.

### CloudCoin
CloudCoin is a pseudo virtual currency service, providing a free-to-use, universally-compatable platform for ingame currency as well as a uniform platform for trading of virtual goods.

### CloudDisk
CloudDisk is a free-to-use cloud storage service. Providing up to 10 slots, storing 1 KB each, you can store 10 KB of save data instantaneously. CloudDisk supports cross-program and cross-project visibility. CloudDisk also enables publically-hosted psuedo-FTP files that can be downloaded into a Scratch project, as well as support for uploading large files for public usage.
